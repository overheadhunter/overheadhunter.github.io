Time to give my homepage a fresh look and feel. This might also be the right moment to stop using Wordpress and look for a more lightweight solution. And there it is: GitHub Pages.

Free hosting, free CDN, publishing by commit-and-pushing sites? In the ears of a developer this sounds like heaven. But it gets even better: [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) allows me to simply write posts using markdown! This is the future :smiley:

I just copied some of my older posts and will migrate this site now.
